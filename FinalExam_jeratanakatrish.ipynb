In Week 7 (Data Parsing & Dictionaries), we’re taught to anticipate missing keys or unexpected formats when working with external data, but the code assumes the weather API will always return complete and correct data, which is risky. Finally, Week 8 (Exception Handling Best Practices) emphasizes the importance of avoiding generic except clauses, encouraging students to catch specific errors and provide informative messages—something this function fails to do by returning a vague \"Error occurred\" without context\n",

This helps catch runtime issues without advanced error types.Data + Control Flow (Week 7–8): Instead of using a real API, I simulated weather data using a hardcoded list of cities. This mirrors earlier exercises where functions return static data based on simple conditions.Doctest (Week 9): I added doctest examples in the function’s docstring for automated testing. These follow the format introduced in Week 9 labs — straightforward and great for catching input/output issues.\n",

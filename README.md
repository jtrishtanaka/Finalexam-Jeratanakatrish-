Section Summaries
Section 1 - Pseudocode & Planning
Have high-level pseudocode for task management functionality.

Follow structures taught in Week 3 and Week 4 including loop planning, conditionals, and output formatting.

Readability and clear flow was also focused on for beginner programmers.

Section 2 - Iterative Debugging
Logic errors in user input and weather API communication have been identified and resolved.

Deployment of Week 4 debugs such as strategic print statements for tracing and stepwise testing.

Have kept good documenting for all debugging iterations and improvements.

Section 3 - Function Refinement
Applied refined_safe_weather_data_fetch(city) using techniques introduced only on Week 8:

try/except blocks without particularly naming exception types

simple string validation using if/else statements

providing return value of None or dictionary depended on outcome 

Have included doctest-formatted test cases basing on practices from Week 9

Not allowing any advanced handling (like specific exceptions, multiple except blocks..)

Section 4 - Manual Implementation
Have achieved a basic task manager with:

display_menu(): used basic print formatting (Week 3)

get_user_choice(): included simple input validation (Week 6)

main(): handled main-loop logic through while/if structures (Week 5)

All the functions used adhered to the constraints of Weeks 4- 6 regarding logic, naming conventions, and style.

Inserted doctests where feasible for functions that could be tested.

Course Compliance Statement
All work of this repository is bound by:

Using only the introduced techniques from Weeks 1 to 8 and 10

Avoiding:

Advanced error handling

Custom exceptions or classes

External Python libraries unless expressly approved

Logic that exceeds Lab 5 to 8 in complexity

Personal Reflection
This exam reinforces the most important concepts in programming that include :

Structuring pseudocode before writing the full implementations.

Implementing basic error handling strategies for user facing programs.

Simple, maintainable coding using the foundational skills this course teaches.

Building logical flows using if/else, while loops, and validation of a user input. 

Application of doctest methodology for simple functional testing. 

It also gave me confidence to tell me that i can submit codes that are technically correct and yet simple as per the course.

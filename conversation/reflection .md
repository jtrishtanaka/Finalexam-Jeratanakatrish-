SECTION 4.2 Course-Connected Reflection (10 marks)

 1.Workflow Balance with Course Learning
 From my structured planning of function structure through those learnt during the modular design and incremental testing lectures, I applied the learned concepts. I summarised and wrote out flows and pseudocode according to the class examples, building the diagnostic structure of my solution before writing any real Python. All syntax and validation were meant to employ AI, but I designed the core decisions such as how to form loops and accept user input in accordance with the strategies learnt through lecture. Using this separation of duties was described as the human-led architecture, AI-assisted refinement model per Week 5. In doing so, the logic was aligned with course expectations but used AI to effectively make it happen.

  2.Course Concept Application
 I implemented the "Error Handling Mindset" learned in Week 7: Exceptions & Defensive Programming into remove\_task() by taking into consideration user input errors such as an index that is not an integer. I created a try-except block that manages both ValueError and IndexError within one clean structure. For "Defensive Programming", first I checked the task list to be empty before listing or deleting any-it follows patterns from Week 5 Loop Design & Safeguards. These practices gave safety and predictability for testing edge cases during my manual tests.

3.Learning Transfer
I will apply a fully functional, iterable refinement mechanism to my final project. I develop it step by step so that some testing and feedback would improve it. I am going to improve one technique called input validation, which was pointed out in the feedback of my Assignment 2 when I was building this weather wise app about being too basic. I will layer checks for user input by using Week 6 Input Handling techniques to ensure robustness and clarity in function access, such as task selection or deletion, that are driven by the user.
